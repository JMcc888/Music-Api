I actually have no idea how readme files usually go, but I wanted to drop this here for clarity for not only readers, but myself as well as the project progresses in growth.

You may notice that there's now a users.JSON file in the data folder, that's so it won't take 10 years to test out the registration routes as I keep forgetting some of the information I'm entering.

Ironically, I forgot both of my user accounts' information only to remember that its stored in a local fileðŸ—¿

Boss Account is a publisher so he can create while test is only a user

Below are some fast sign up and login samples if needed for testing

signing up boss credentials:
{
"email": "Boss@boss.com",
"username": "Boss",
"password": "THEBIGBOSSLOL",
"role": "publisher"
}

logging in boss
{
"email": "Boss@boss.com",
"password": "THEBIGBOSSLOL" 
}
