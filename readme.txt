I actually have no idea how readme files usually go, but I wanted to drop this here for clarity for not only readers, but myself as well as the project progresses in growth.

V2 Update
This file is now deprecated ðŸ—¿

V3 Update
Suddenly, this file has use again
After redoing the user accounts tied with the reviews, I decided to slap the newly generated user id's here for reference if I ever need them again


Final Submission Update
I lied, I never did slap the ids here
I plan to do more with this api in the future, but I shall leave the data as is at the moment
Some of the information is still filler such as some artist birthplaces, but the data still processes correctly
By this, features such as geosphere work just fine, and other data generated values such as bpm which was never fully implemented at the time of this project's submission
